		<h1>AWS QnABot -- CSV file to JSON converter tool </h1>
		<p>
		To support easier ingestion of your content in CSV format, we created this tool to help with the ingestion of CSV content into QnA Bot Designer.
		Please refer to the CSV input file specifications below. </p>
		
		<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" bgcolor="silver">
			<tr>
				<td align="left" nowrap colspan="2">
					<div class="file_spec">
						<b>Input File Specifications</b> <br>
						You can get started with your CSV file with just a few fields: <br>
						<ul>
							<li><b>question_identifier</b> -- a unique identifier for each question.</li>
							<li><b>question_type</b> -- there are 2 types in QnA Bot (qna and quiz). This tool supports "qna" type. </li>
							<li><b>question</b> -- question that your users will ask. This field supports input for 1 question. You can use the QnA Bot Designer to add more.</li>
							<li><b>answer</b> -- answer applicable for the {question} field. </li>
							<li><b>markdown_answer</b> (optional) -- answer applicable for the {question} field in markdown format.</li>
						</ul>
