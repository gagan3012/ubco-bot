Firstly, you could use the definition: the expectation of a random variable is the probability of an event multiplied by the amount of times the event happens. Alternatively, you can use expectation by conditioning: define the random variable in terms of another, and condition on it. Then find the conditional expectation in terms of the other variable, and finally find the expectation.",
