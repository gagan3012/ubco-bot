## [4.2.4]

## [4.2.2]

## [4.2.0]
- New Kendra FAQ support (Beta version) using the setting KENDRA_FAQ_INDEX. New menu item in Designer UI to export Questions as a Kendra FAQ. See revised Blog Post for details.
- New GetSessionAttribute Handlebars helper to obtain session attribute. Works similar to lodash get(). Will not through exception and will return a default value.
- Enhanced handlebars to support string concatenation including handlevar 'variables' like Session Attributes and UserInfo, etc. Use case, e.g. to build a url containing a users email, eg a google calendar URL. Example of syntax now supported - in this case to dynamically build a personalized URL based on user info. {{setSessionAttr 'link' 'https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=' UserInfo.Email '&ctz=America%2FNew_York'}}
- Moved 'previous' and 'navigation' session attributes under a new 'qnabotcontext' session attribute so that Connect (and other) clients have fewer session attributes to preserve.
- Allows Chaining rule Lambda function to return a modified session object in addition to the string for chaining.
- Allows Chaining of up to 10 documents. Each document's Lambda hooks will also be invoked in sequence if defined.
- Added a new Repeat QID in the QNAUtility example package. Allows QnABot to easily repeat the last answer.  
- Allow the chaining rule to specify a specific QID rather than an answer. A QID can be specified in the chaining rule by using string such as QID::<qid> e.g. QID::Admin.001. Note, the new QID::<qid> syntax can also be used from the webUI, say as button values if/when you prefer to target a specific QID (exact query) rather than rely on question matching.
- Fixed a defect to allow conditional chaining to be invoked after an elicit response bot failure.
- Upgrades to and installs ElasticSearch 7.7.

## [4.1.0]
- Install / Upgrade now supports the option to configure S3 Buckets and Elastic Search cluster using encryption at rest
- Install / Upgrade now supports the option to require Cognito based user authorization to access the built-in full screen web UI (Public/Private parameter in template) - Public is the default
- Added two settings parameters to enforce user identity verification check, so that bot can be secured for use by authenticated users only
    - ENFORCE_VERIFIED_IDENTITY. Default is false. Set to true to make QnABot require verified identity from client
    - NO_VERIFIED_IDENTITY_QUESTION. The default is "no_verified_identity". If user identity cannot be verified, replace question string with this. If not verified, the system will respond to user's question with the result of searching for NO_VERIFIED_IDENTITY_QUESTION. This allows a customizable message which informs the user that they must log in. A default question with qid "no_verified_identity" is included in QNAUtility example package.
- Enhanced Kendra fallback integration to use a specific answer if there is a best answer available and bold face highlighted words from Kendra response
- Added Comprehend sentiment analysis to all utterances and text captured by the QNAFreeText elicit response bot
- Enhanced Kibana dashboard to identify Lex client channels - Connect, Web, SMS

    - Added session attribute named "qnabot_qid" that holds the matching question id found in elastic search
    - Added session attribute "qnabot_gotanswer" that holds boolean true/fale if an answer was fround
    - Encapsulating all Kendra and Elicit Response Bot session attributes into a single "qnabotcontext" attribute making it easier to store and reset in Connect contact flow
- Added new QNAYesNoExit elicit response bot which allows a user to exit the YesNoExit question using "exit", "bye", "quit", "admin", "rep","representative","stop", "help", "bye", "goodbye" which sets the Yes_No_Exit slot value / session attribute to "Exit".
