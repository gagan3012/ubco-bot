# User Guide

## End User Guide
**Suggestions and assumption to consider for the best chatbot-user interaction:**

- English is the only language supported by the UBCO Chatbot. 
- Short and simple questions/sentences work best. 
- Always ask one question/sentence at a time. 
- Do not ask follow up questions, rather formulate a new question.
- Do not use emojis.
- Avoid using slang and contractions.
- Avoid typos. If the user wrote a typo in the question and the chatbot did not provide a valid answer, retry making the same question but without the typo.
- If the user does not want to type, it can use the voice dictation feature by clicking on the mic button. 
- The user can validate the response of the chatbot by clicking thumbs up if the chatbot provided a satisfactory answer, or thumbs down if it did not.
