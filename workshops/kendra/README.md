# Kendra Integration

There are 2 use cases of the Kendra integration. This tutorial covers both parts. The first uses Kendra's FAQ model to improve QnABot's understanding of human language and find better matches to questions. The second covers the Kendra Fallback engine which performs searches over documents in Kendra to extract answers for unanticipated questions.

## Section 1: Kendra FAQ

### Economics class example

QnABot now offers a new machine-learning based query method based on Amazon Kendra to improve question-matching accuracies and reduce the tuning workload. Let's try a simple example to illustrate the concept:

#### Part 1: See the limitations of ElasticSearch

Open the QnABot designer console. You can find the link to the 'ContentDesignerURL' under the Outputs tab of the launched CloudFormation template. If you do not know your login, you should have received an email once the template finished creating with a temporary password. The default username is 'Admin'.
    
<img src="./cftemplate_designer_url.png?raw=true" width="350" height="400">

1. Add the following question to your designer console:

    QID: *econ.1*
  
    Question: *What are the main goals of an economy?*
  
    Answer: *All economies in the world try to achieve 3 things: Growth, High employment*
    
    <img src="./designer_add_button.png?raw=true" width="650" height="150">
        
2. Open QnABot client and enter the question "What are the main goals of an economy?"

<img src="./qnabot_tools_menu.png?raw=true" width="300" height="100"> 

<img src="./qnabot_tools_open_client.png?raw=true" width="200" height="450"> 

3. Then, try out a different phrasing: *What main objectives do economies try to achieve?*

You'll find that the ElasticSearch based QnABot does not know that these two questions mean the same thing. We're going to see how Amazon Kendra can address this limitation.

#### Part 2: Create an Amazon Kendra index

1. Go to [Amazon Kendra](http://console.aws.amazon.com/kendra) and click on **Create Index** in the top right corner.
2. Provide an *Index name* like *explore-qnabot* and optional *Description*.
3. Choose the recommended *Create a new role* for the IAM role and provide a name like *qnabot-idx-role*.

<img src="./create_kendra_idx_opts.png?raw=true" width="500" height="450">

4. Press **Next**. Decide if you want the Enterprise or Developer edition. 

    Kendra's Free Tier of usage provides the Developer edition for free usage of up to 750 hours for the first 30 days. Both editions have a query rate that is strictly enforced at 0.5 queries/second. The Enterprise edition provides the option to increase this limit for additional cost. The Developer edition cannot increase query capacity. For more information on pricing details, go to [https://aws.amazon.com/kendra/pricing/](https://aws.amazon.com/kendra/pricing/).
  
5. **Create** the index and wait for it to become active. **Note that this takes about ~30 minutes to complete. You will NOT be able to move forward in the tutorial before this index has finished creating.**


#### Part 3: Set up KendraFAQ in the designer console

1. Log in to the Content Designer, and go to settings. Scroll down until you see the field *KENDRA_FAQ_INDEX*.

<img src="./qnabot_tools_open_settings.png?raw=true" width="200" height="450">

2. Enter your Kendra index ID copied from the Kendra console.

<img src="./qnabot_settings_kendra_idx.png?raw=true" width="400" height="100">

<br>

<img src="./kendra_console_readme.png?raw=true" width="250" height="300">

3. Save the settings and return to the home page of the web interface.
4. Choose the top right edit card menu (⋮) to open up a drop-down menu. Press **Sync Kendra FAQ**.

<img src="./sync_kendra_faq_menu.png?raw=true" width="200" height="200">

5. Wait until your designer console finishes syncing to the Kendra index. **This may take a couple minutes.**
6. When it shows the *Sync Complete* status, you can go to your QnABot index in the Kendra console and check the FAQs tab to see a newly created (or updated) `qna-facts` FAQ. You will need to sync your questions to a Kendra FAQ each time you update the content in your designer console.
7. Go back into the QnABot client and try out the new phrasing again: "What main objectives do economies try to achieve?"

You'll see that with Kendra-based question matching, the QnABot can understand variations in human language better! Amazon Kendra is an enterprise search service powered by machine learning and natural language processing. This means that it can apply different semantic meanings over the terms in a user’s question to better understand the meaning of complex human language, and identify better answers. With Amazon Kendra, QnABot is able to comprehend that these two question phrasings mean the same thing.

### QnABot Answer Sources
There are four unique sources that supply answers to QnABot.
- **ElasticSearch**: The first method is the standard ElasticSearch implementation. If the `KENDRA_FAQ_INDEX` is not enabled or if a feature is only supported on ElasticSearch, then QnABot will default to this query method. 
- **KendraFAQ**: Then there is the KendraFAQ method. If the custom parameter `KENDRA_FAQ_INDEX` is set and if that query is supported through the Kendra integration, then QnABot relies on Amazon Kendra's natural language and deep learning models to understand and match a question to an answer. This section walked through setting up this KendraFAQ model.
- **ElasticSearch Fallback**: If a question does not find any matches through the KendraFAQ method, this integration provides an optional ElasticSearch Fallback which is enabled by default in settings (`KENDRA_FAQ_ES_FALLBACK`).
- **Kendra Fallback**: Finally, if no matches are found to a curated question, then QnABot has the ability to search through documents uploaded to a Kendra index via the Kendra Fallback engine. This feature is enabled through the `ALT_SEARCH_KENDRA_INDEXES` setting. Part 2 below covers how to launch this mode.

Turning on the `ENABLE_DEBUG_RESPONSES` parameter in settings will allow you to see which source generated a QnABot response.


### Limitations of the Kendra FAQ integration
The Kendra integration is currently a Beta feature for you to try. As the Kendra service develops frameworks to support similar use cases, its capabilities will continue changing. For this reason, here we document the limitations and current functions here.

**Query Throttling Rates**

- Kendra by default throttles queries to a rate of 1 query every 2 seconds on average. If there are many simultaneous users on QnABot at a time, expect there to be significant latency or even failure to execute Kendra queries. The current implementation is optimized to support 10 concurrent users where each user will wait a maximum of 4.5 seconds before receiving a response to their question.
- The Kendra Enterprise indices allow you to purchase addition query units to increase the throughput to support higher numbers of concurrent users. For additional information on adjusting query capacity, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/adjusting-capacity.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/adjusting-capacity.html).
- To optimize your QnABot for different numbers of users or use cases, see the fields `KENDRA_FAQ_MAX_RETRIES` and `KENDRA_FAQ_CONFIG_RETRY_DELAY`. They deal with Kendra's in-built exponential delay and retry function in the case that a query times out or is blocked due to too many other simultaneous queries. The first setting sets the maximum number of retries, and the second sets the base number of milliseconds that Kendra delays before retrying a query.

**One-word Questions, Topics, QID Querying**
- Kendra FAQ currently does not find matches to single word questions, such as 'help' or 'hello'. QnABot falls back to using ElasticSearch to answer these questions.
- Kendra does not currently support follow-up questions using Topics. QnABot defaults to using ElasticSearch to identify an answer when a topic is defined.

### Additional Question-Matching Examples  
These are additional example questions where the new phrasing fails to find a match using ElasticSearch, but succeeds with the Kendra integration.

QID: *solar.1*
- Question: *How old is the sun?*
- Answer: *Our sun is 4.6 billion years old.*
- New phrasing: *What is the age of the sun?*

QID: bus.1
- Question: *What are the main functions of management?*
- Answer: *There are 4 main functions of management: planning, organizing, directing, and controlling.*
- New phrasing: *What main operations does management fulfill?*



## Section 2: Kendra Fallback Search

### Solar-facts example

QnABot now offers a new machine-learning based query method based on Amazon Kendra to improve question-matching accuracies and reduce the tuning workload. Let's try a simple example to illustrate the concept:

#### Part 1: See the limitations of FAQ question-matching
What if you want to ask the QnABot a question that is not present in the FAQs but may be in related documents? This feature enables Kendra to perform a search on any uploaded content (e.g., PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, etc.) and retrieve those results in QnABot.

#### Part 2: Add content to a Kendra index
1. **THIS ASSUMES YOU HAVE COMPLETED PART 2 OF SECTION 1 (Create an Amazon Kendra index). If not, go back and complete those steps.**
2. Create an S3 bucket.

    a. In the S3 console, click on **Create bucket** and enter a *Bucket name* such as qnabot-docs 
   (your bucket name must start with 'qna' and needs to be unique. This naming convention allows access to objects
   using signed urls stored in this bucket). Press **Create** to build the bucket.
    
    <img src="./s3_create_bucket.png?raw=true" width="300" height="100">
    <br>
    <img src="./s3_create_bucket_step1.png?raw=true" width="500" height="300">

*Note: This creates a bucket with default permissions. Should other permissions be required be sure to alter
the settings as necessary.*
    
    b. **Upload** these PDFs into your new S3 bucket. 
    
    - [solar_mysteries_book.pdf](./solar_mysteries_book.pdf)

    - [sun_lithograph.pdf](./sun_lithograph.pdf)
    
    <img src="./s3_bucket_upload.png?raw=true" width="400" height="100">    

3. Go to the Kendra console and select your index. Click on the **Step 2. Add data sources** button and select the Amazon S3 Connector.

<img src="./kendra_add_datasource.png?raw=true" width="650" height="300">

4. Name your data source (e.g., *qnabot-content*) and press **Next**.
5. Browse for your S3 bucket to enter its location.
6. Choose the recommended *Create new role* for the IAM role and provide a name like *kendra-s3-qnabot-access*.

<img src="./kendra_role.png?raw=true" width="800" height="150">

7. You can choose how frequently to sync this data source with the Kendra index. If you will be updating content frequently, perhaps select a periodic option. Else, go with our *Run on demand* default.

<img src="./kendra_sync_schedule.png?raw=true" width="500" height="150">

8. **Create** the data source. **This may take a couple minutes.**
9. Once the data source has been created, press on **Sync now** to sync the uploaded materials into the Kendra index. **This will take ~30 minutes**.

<img src="./kendra_sync_datasource.png?raw=true" width="600" height="300">


#### Part 3: Set up KendraFallback in Designer Console

1. Log in to the Content Designer, and go to settings. Scroll down until you see the field *ALT_SEARCH_KENDRA_INDEXES*.
2. Enter your Kendra index ID copied from the Kendra console. You can provide a list of Kendra indices if you have data sources in multiple Kendra locations. If you have multiple, make sure to list them in an array of strings like this: ```["a672e3a2-nnnn-nnnn-do-not-copy", "4a0266cb-7760-do-not-copy"]```

<img src="./kendra_console_readme.png?raw=true" width="250" height="300">

3. Save the settings and return to the home page of the web interface.
   
4. Go back into the QnABot client and try out some questions about the sun!

### Example questions
There are a couple different types of responses from the KendraFallback engine. 

#### Top answer
For some queries, Kendra is able to find an answer in the uploaded documents with a very high confidence and yields a 'top answer' phrase. QnABot takes the Kendra results and shortens its response to only contain this phrase and the source link. 

For example, ask QnABot *When did Galileo first see sunspots?* or *How many regions does the sun have?* and take a look at the concise response returned. 

If you are interacting through a voice channel (such as an Echo or via the microphone on the bottom right of the web interface), QnABot will speak this shortened answer instead of the full text extract that it was retrieved from.

#### Most relevant phrases with document search
In other cases, QnABot is able to find a text excerpt that most closely answers the question and it highlights the most relevant phrases of this response. This is returned along with other top results and their source links, enabling QnABot to act like a search engine over the uploaded documents.

Try asking *What is the composition of the sun?* to see how QnABot selectively highlights the most important elements of a text extract.

If a highly relevant phrase is identified, then this selective emphasis also applies to the voice response, which will read out the first 2 sentences of the most important highlighted text to provide context to the answer.

#### For more question suggestions, try:
- What is a solar flare?
- How many Earth's could fit inside the sun?
- What are Earth's atmosphere layers?
- Who makes the first Earth-centered model of the solar system?
- Define solar wind

You'll notice that that your designer console list has no curated answers for these questions. Instead of saying sadly we could not answer the question, Amazon Kendra is searched and possible answers or discovered text are returned. The links are clickable as well, so if the document is available to be read, it can be downloaded from the S3 bucket.
