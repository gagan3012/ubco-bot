# UBC Okanagan Chatbot
## Project Overview
The UBCO Chatbot is a complement to the UBCO project. It aims to be a user-friendly channel of communication that students can easily use to ask questions about UBCOâ€™s events and services such as: housing, academic advising, parking, among others. This will allow students to get the relevant information they need without having to spend a lot of time and effort looking for it on different websites.

# High Level Architecture Diagram

The first interaction that the user has with the chatbot is through the UI, which was built using AWS Lex Web UI (https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lex-web-ui). The UI is then connected to the backend via API gateway. 

From there, the AWS Lex receives the query and through custom Lambda functions and predefined Lex bots, generates answers and stores them in a Dynamodb Table. The backend of the bot is supported by Elastisearch which is the server of the bot.
