# UBC Okanagan Chatbot
## Project Overview
The UBCO Chatbot is a complement to the UBCO project. It aims to be a user-friendly channel of communication that students can easily use to ask questions about UBCOâ€™s events and services such as: housing, academic advising, parking, among others. This will allow students to get the relevant information they need without having to spend a lot of time and effort looking for it on different websites.
